## What to do

Produce the post-patch knowledge base state for the heroes in this batch. This KB is read by the analyst on the *next* patch, so write it as durable state, not as a patch summary.

1. **hero_updates**: for each mover, the fields that changed. Allowed fields: role, archetypes, tier, trend, why, core_items, builds (full replacement list of {name, damage, core_items, popularity, notes}), matchups ({beats, loses_to}), enabled_by, countered_by, notes. When an item change kills or creates a build, update `builds`, not just `notes`. When another hero's change alters a matchup, update `matchups`. Set `last_changed_patch` to "{{patch_title}}" for heroes that had direct changes. `why` is 1-2 sentences of present-tense state ("strong because X; weak to Y"), not a changelog. `notes` may hold a short changelog line (keep the last 3 lines, newest first). Do not touch heroes not in this batch.

   For each hero, output only the fields whose value actually changes. Omit any field that stays the same — omitted fields are kept as-is in the KB. Include `builds` only if at least one build is created, killed, or its core items change; when you include it, it is a full replacement list. Include `matchups` only if a matchup changes.
2. **change_log**: one line per KB edit you made, for the human to skim.

Tier is one of S/A/B/C/D. Trend is rising/stable/falling.
